# hello-world
First go at a repository

Taking the Data Science Toolbox course over on Coursera! Looking forward to learning more and doing ore! I've always loved making numbers dance and seeing what stories they can tell and am excited to learn how to do that on a greater scale.
Great at excel but I don't know much else. YET.
